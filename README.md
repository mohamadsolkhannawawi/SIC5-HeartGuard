Better Way for a Better Life.</i></p></div>📌 IntroductionCardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for 17.9 million deaths annually. In Indonesia alone, 1 in 10 deaths are due to coronary heart disease. Early detection through methods like Electrocardiography (ECG) is crucial but often hindered by inadequate healthcare facilities and high consultation costs.HeartGuard is an innovative solution designed to tackle this problem. We provide an affordable and accessible system that combines IoT hardware, Machine Learning, and an AI Chatbot to empower users with early detection capabilities for Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) risks, right from their homes.✨ Key Features❤️ Real-Time Health Monitoring: An intuitive dashboard displays key health metrics such as Heart Rate (BPM), Body Temperature, and Body Mass Index (BMI) tracked by our IoT device.🤖 AI-Powered Risk Prediction: Utilizes a Gradient Boosting machine learning model to predict the 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease, enabling timely intervention.💬 Interactive AI Chatbot: Engage with an intelligent chatbot for real-time risk assessment, health-related queries, and personalized recommendations based on your health data.🚀 Live Demo & LinksWeb Application: heartguard.streamlit.appVideo Demo: bit.ly/VideoDemoHeartGuard🛠️ Tech Stack & DatasetTechnologyMachine Learning: Python, Scikit-learnPrediction Model: Gradient BoostingWeb Framework: StreamlitHardware: IoT-enabled sensors for health metric collectionDatasetThis project utilizes the Framingham Heart Study dataset from Kaggle.
