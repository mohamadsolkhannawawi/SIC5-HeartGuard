## 📌 Problem Background

Cardiovascular disease is the **leading cause of death worldwide**, with **17.9 million deaths** annually. In Indonesia, **1 in 10 people** die from **coronary heart disease (CHD)**. Early detection via electrocardiography (ECG) is critical, yet often hindered by:

* **Limited Access:** Uneven distribution of proper healthcare facilities across regions.
* **High Cost:** Doctor consultations and cardiac screenings are expensive.
* **Dependency on Medication:** Many rely solely on long-term medications instead of prevention.

---

## 💡 Our Solution: HeartGuard

**HeartGuard** is an innovative system designed to solve the above issues. We offer an **affordable and accessible solution** combining **IoT devices**, **Machine Learning**, and an **AI-powered Chatbot** that empowers users with **early risk detection** for coronary heart disease directly from their home.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* ❤️ **Real-Time Health Monitoring**
  An intuitive dashboard shows vital metrics such as **Heart Rate (BPM)**, **Body Temperature**, and **Body Mass Index (BMI)**, captured by our IoT sensors.

* 🤖 **AI-Based Risk Prediction**
  A **Gradient Boosting Machine Learning model** predicts the risk of coronary heart disease over the next 10 years based on user data.

* 💬 **Interactive AI Chatbot**
  A conversational chatbot provides **real-time risk assessments**, **health Q\&A**, and **personalized recommendations** based on the user’s health metrics.
